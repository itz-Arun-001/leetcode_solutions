# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/

## Description

Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

Example 2:

Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

Constraints:

	  - 1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 10^4

	  - s and p consist of lowercase English letters.

## Example Test Cases (raw)

```
"cbaebabacd"
"abc"
"abab"
"ab"
```
