# 930. Binary Subarrays With Sum

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/

## Description

Given a binary array nums and an integer goal, return the number of non-empty subarrays with a sum goal.

A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,0,1], goal = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 subarrays are bolded and underlined below:
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,0,0,0], goal = 0
Output: 15

Constraints:

	  - 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4

	  - nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

	  - 0 <= goal <= nums.length

## Example Test Cases (raw)

```
[1,0,1,0,1]
2
[0,0,0,0,0]
0
```
