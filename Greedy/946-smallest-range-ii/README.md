# 910. Smallest Range II

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-range-ii/

## Description

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

For each index i where 0 <= i < nums.length, change nums[i] to be either nums[i] + k or nums[i] - k.

The score of nums is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in nums.

Return the minimum score of nums after changing the values at each index.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1], k = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: The score is max(nums) - min(nums) = 1 - 1 = 0.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,10], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: Change nums to be [2, 8]. The score is max(nums) - min(nums) = 8 - 2 = 6.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,3,6], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Change nums to be [4, 6, 3]. The score is max(nums) - min(nums) = 6 - 3 = 3.

Constraints:

	  - 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4

	  - 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

	  - 0 <= k <= 10^4
