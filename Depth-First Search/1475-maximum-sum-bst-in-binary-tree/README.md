# 1373. Maximum Sum BST in Binary Tree

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-bst-in-binary-tree/

## Description

Given a binary tree root, return the maximum sum of all keys of any sub-tree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

	  - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.

	  - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.

	  - Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,4,3,2,4,2,5,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,6]
Output: 20
Explanation: Maximum sum in a valid Binary search tree is obtained in root node with key equal to 3.

Example 2:

Input: root = [4,3,null,1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: Maximum sum in a valid Binary search tree is obtained in a single root node with key equal to 2.

Example 3:

Input: root = [-4,-2,-5]
Output: 0
Explanation: All values are negatives. Return an empty BST.

Constraints:

	  - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 4 * 10^4].

	  - -4 * 10^4 <= Node.val <= 4 * 10^4

## Example Test Cases (raw)

```
[1,4,3,2,4,2,5,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,6]
[4,3,null,1,2]
[-4,-2,-5]
```
