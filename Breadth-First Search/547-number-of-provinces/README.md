# 547. Number of Provinces

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/

## Description

There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the i^th city and the j^th city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.

Example 1:

Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3

Constraints:

	  - 1 <= n <= 200

	  - n == isConnected.length

	  - n == isConnected[i].length

	  - isConnected[i][j] is 1 or 0.

	  - isConnected[i][i] == 1

	  - isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]

## Example Test Cases (raw)

```
[[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
[[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
```
