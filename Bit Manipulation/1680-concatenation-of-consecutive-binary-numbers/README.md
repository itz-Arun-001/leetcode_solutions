# 1680. Concatenation of Consecutive Binary Numbers

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenation-of-consecutive-binary-numbers/

## Description

Given an integer n, return the decimal value of the binary string formed by concatenating the binary representations of 1 to n in order, modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: "1" in binary corresponds to the decimal value 1.

Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 27
Explanation: In binary, 1, 2, and 3 corresponds to "1", "10", and "11".
After concatenating them, we have "11011", which corresponds to the decimal value 27.

Example 3:

Input: n = 12
Output: 505379714
Explanation: The concatenation results in "1101110010111011110001001101010111100".
The decimal value of that is 118505380540.
After modulo 10^9 + 7, the result is 505379714.

Constraints:

	  - 1 <= n <= 10^5
