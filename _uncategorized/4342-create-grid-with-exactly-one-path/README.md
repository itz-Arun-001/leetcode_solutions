# 3963. Create Grid With Exactly One Path

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/create-grid-with-exactly-one-path/

## Description

You are given two integers m and n, representing the number of rows and columns of a grid.

Construct any m x n grid consisting only of the characters '.' and '#', where:

	  - '.' represents a free cell.

	  - '#' represents an obstacle cell.

A valid path is a sequence of free cells that:

	  - Starts at the top-left cell (0, 0).

	  - Ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1).

	  - Moves only:

		  - Right, from (i, j) to (i, j + 1), or

		  - Down, from (i, j) to (i + 1, j).

Return any grid such that there is exactly one valid path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.

Example 1:

Input: m = 2, n = 3

Output: ["..#","#.."]

Explanation:

The only valid path is: (0,0) &rarr; (0,1) &rarr; (1,1) &rarr; (1,2)

Example 2:

Input: m = 3, n = 3

Output: ["..#","#..","##."]

Explanation:

The only valid path is: (0,0) &rarr; (0,1) &rarr; (1,1) &rarr; (1,2) &rarr; (2,2)

Example 3:

Input: m = 1, n = 4

Output: ["...."]

Explanation:

The only valid path is: (0,0) &rarr; (0,1) &rarr; (0,2) &rarr; (0,3)

Constraints:

	  - 1 <= m, n <= 25
