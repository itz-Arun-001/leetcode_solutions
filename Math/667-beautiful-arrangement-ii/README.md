**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-arrangement-ii/

## Description

Given two integers n and k, construct a list answer that contains n different positive integers ranging from 1 to n and obeys the following requirement:

	  - Suppose this list is answer = [a1, a2, a3, ... , an], then the list [|a1 - a2|, |a2 - a3|, |a3 - a4|, ... , |an-1 - an|] has exactly k distinct integers.

Return the list answer. If there multiple valid answers, return any of them.

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation: The [1,2,3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [1,1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1

Example 2:

Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: [1,3,2]
Explanation: The [1,3,2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2,1] has exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.

Constraints:

	  - 1 <= k < n <= 10^4
