# 395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-least-k-repeating-characters/

## Description

Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k.

if no such substring exists, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.

Example 2:

Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.

Constraints:

	  - 1 <= s.length <= 10^4

	  - s consists of only lowercase English letters.

	  - 1 <= k <= 10^5

## Example Test Cases (raw)
