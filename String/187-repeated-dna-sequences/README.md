# 187. Repeated DNA Sequences

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/

## Description

The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

	  - For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.

When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]

Example 2:

Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]

Constraints:

	  - 1 <= s.length <= 10^5

	  - s[i] is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.

## Example Test Cases (raw)

```
"AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
"AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
```
