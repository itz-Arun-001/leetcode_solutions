# 1286. Iterator for Combination

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/iterator-for-combination/

## Description

Design the CombinationIterator class:

	  - CombinationIterator(string characters, int combinationLength) Initializes the object with a string characters of sorted distinct lowercase English letters and a number combinationLength as arguments.

	  - next() Returns the next combination of length combinationLength in lexicographical order.

	  - hasNext() Returns true if and only if there exists a next combination.

Example 1:

Input
["CombinationIterator", "next", "hasNext", "next", "hasNext", "next", "hasNext"]
[["abc", 2], [], [], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, "ab", true, "ac", true, "bc", false]

Explanation
CombinationIterator itr = new CombinationIterator("abc", 2);
itr.next();    // return "ab"
itr.hasNext(); // return True
itr.next();    // return "ac"
itr.hasNext(); // return True
itr.next();    // return "bc"
itr.hasNext(); // return False

Constraints:

	  - 1 <= combinationLength <= characters.length <= 15

	  - All the characters of characters are unique.

	  - At most 10^4 calls will be made to next and hasNext.

	  - It is guaranteed that all calls of the function next are valid.

## Example Test Cases (raw)

```
["CombinationIterator","next","hasNext","next","hasNext","next","hasNext"]
[["abc",2],[],[],[],[],[],[]]
```
