**Difficulty:** Medium
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/

## Description

Given two strings s1 and s2, return true if s2 contains a permutation of s1, or false otherwise.

In other words, return true if one of s1's permutations is the substring of s2.

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
Output: true
Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").

Example 2:

Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidboaoo"
Output: false

Constraints:

	  - 1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 10^4

	  - s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.

## Example Test Cases (raw)

```
"ab"
"eidbaooo"
"ab"
"eidboaoo"
```
