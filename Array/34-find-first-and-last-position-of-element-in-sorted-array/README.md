# 34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/

## Description

Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: [-1,-1]

Constraints:

	  - 0 <= nums.length <= 10^5

	  - -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

	  - nums is a non-decreasing array.

	  - -10^9 <= target <= 10^9

## Example Test Cases (raw)

```
[5,7,7,8,8,10]
8
[5,7,7,8,8,10]
6
