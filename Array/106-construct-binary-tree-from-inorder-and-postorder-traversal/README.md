# 106. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-inorder-and-postorder-traversal/

## Description

Given two integer arrays inorder and postorder where inorder is the inorder traversal of a binary tree and postorder is the postorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.

Example 1:

Input: inorder = [9,3,15,20,7], postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]
Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Example 2:

Input: inorder = [-1], postorder = [-1]
Output: [-1]

Constraints:

	  - 1 <= inorder.length <= 3000

	  - postorder.length == inorder.length

	  - -3000 <= inorder[i], postorder[i] <= 3000

	  - inorder and postorder consist of unique values.

	  - Each value of postorder also appears in inorder.

	  - inorder is guaranteed to be the inorder traversal of the tree.

	  - postorder is guaranteed to be the postorder traversal of the tree.

## Example Test Cases (raw)

```
[9,3,15,20,7]
[9,15,7,20,3]
[-1]
[-1]
```
